# Make-U-Bill

This is a very simple project to track your finances. üí≤üí≤üí≤
\
The idea to make this project came to me from my personal struggle to keep back of my expenses.
\
With the introduction of **UPI** and other **digital payment methods**, it has become very easy to make payments. 
But, it has also become **very easy to lose track of your expenses**.

### This is a very common scenario that you might have seen on your everyday life  üëá
> You are on your way back from work with your 'buddies' and see a new restaurant. You decide to go in and have a good time.
> Or, maybe, one of your friends want to buy something for his own use... 
> 
> You recall that you might also need this in future ??
> 
> So, even if you didn't immediately need it, you buy it. 
> Then later you may find that you don't even feel like using what you have bought just now !!

### What does the above scenario tell you?

- **To lose friends?** üò•
- **To come back alone from the office?** üö∂
- **Stay away from new restaurants?** üò±

> No to all of those above right?
